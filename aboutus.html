                <p>We are a pioneering non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the Philippines, dedicated to the preservation of the country's rich biodiversity and the sustainable management of its natural resources. You can check out the full video of our history in our YouTube Channel!</p>
                <p id="orgbg">Established in 1972, Haribon is at the forefront of environmental conservation, engaging in scientific research, educational programs, and advocacy efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats. In 1995, the Haribon Foundation established a marine sanctuary dedicated to radiant seahorses. The location gained formal protection in 1998 and was recognized as the most exceptional marine protected area in the country by the MPA Support Network in 2007. We place a strong emphasis on community involvement, working collaboratively with local communities and fostering partnerships with various stakeholders. Haribon is committed to raising awareness, conducting research, and implementing on-the-ground initiatives to address environmental challenges and promote a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. </p>
